# String-Contains-with-8086-asm

Objective = Become familiar with Procedures and Program Flow Control operations in 8086 emulator software.

Work = Write an assembly program that is able to determine if a char sequence contains a second char sequence or not.
1. Define two char arrays.
2. Determine if the first char sequence contains the second char sequence (the whole sequence, in order). For example, ‘MICROCOMPUTERS’ contains ‘MICRO’ but does not contain ‘MICOR’.
3. Define a PRINT procedure that prints the result as the example below. Defined char sequences may vary, so you need to create a procedure that can print any given char sequences.
